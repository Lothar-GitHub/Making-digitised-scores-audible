The Zentralbibliothek Zurich and several other Libraries in Switzerland own large numbers of music scores. Several of these scores are accessible via the digital platforms [e-manuscripta](https://www.e-manuscripta.ch/emanus/noten/nav/classification/50) and [e-rara](https://www.e-rara.ch/nav/index?&facets=type%3D%22notated_music%22). But what if you want to hear the music instead of just seeing the score sheets?<br><br>
We would like to make digitized music scores deposited on e-manuscripta and e-rara audible, using OMR and notational software. Our overall goal would be to develop a workflow resulting in audio files. Such a workflow would at any rate include manual steps. Rather than developing a fully automated pipeline, this little explorative study is an attempt to find out about the potentials of OMR in a cultural heritage context, possibly making written music more accessible.
